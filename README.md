# sociaml-facebook-api
> An OCaml library for accessing the Facebook API.

**Development on this project has ceased.**

This project provided an OCaml library for access the [Facebook API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v1.0). It should probably be considered out of data and most likely does not work with the latest version of the Facebook API.

## Installation

This library is distributed through [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/), simply run `opam install social-facebook-api`. The [Findlib](http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html) package name is `sociaml_facebook_api`.

## Development setup

Development requires a working OCaml installation and [OASIS](http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/) installed. It is recommended that you use [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/) to install and configure Ocaml and OASIS. Please refer to the `Makefile` for build targets.

## Meta

Distributed under the ISC license. See ``LICENSE`` for more information.
